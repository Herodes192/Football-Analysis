# Tactical Suggestions TODO

**Last Updated:** 23 de dezembro de 2025

## 1. Game-State–Aware Adjustments (CRITICAL)

### Add: Game State Adaptation

**If Leading**
- Press: MEDIUM BLOCK
- Tempo: CONTROLLED
- Fullbacks: One stays, one overlaps

**If Drawing**
- Press: HIGH
- Tempo: FAST

**If Trailing**
- Press: VERY HIGH
- Defensive Line: +5–10m
- Risk tolerance: HIGH

**Why this matters**
- Prevents over-pressing when ahead
- AI feels “match-aware”
- Huge realism boost

---

## 2. Rest Defense & Counter Prevention (BIG GAP)

### Add: Rest Defense Structure
- Shape in possession: 2-3 base
- CBs: Hold central lanes
- DM: Screen zone 14
- Fullbacks: Staggered (one high, one deeper)

**Trigger**
- Opponent counter threat detected

**Why**
- High press + overlapping FBs = counter vulnerability
- Elite teams win by controlling transitions

---

## 3. Pressing Triggers (Elite Detail)

### Add: Pressing Triggers
- Back pass to CB or GK
- Poor first touch
- Wide build-up near touchline
- Opponent facing own goal

### Add: Pressing Trap
- Force play wide → isolate fullback → 3v1 press

**Why**
- Makes the AI actionable, not generic
- Massive tactical realism

---

## 4. Build-Up Pattern Suggestions (Missing Phase)

### Add: Build-Up Play
- Phase 1: GK → CB split
- Phase 2: DM drops between CBs
- Phase 3: Inverted winger occupies half-space

**Alternative**
- Direct build-up if press intensity > threshold

**Why**
- AI should guide positional play, not only outcomes

---

## 5. Player Profile Exploitation (VERY POWERFUL)

### Add: Targeted Player Matchups
- Isolate slow CB vs fast winger
- Attack weaker fullback side
- Force play onto opponent’s weak foot

**AI Trigger**
- Speed mismatch > X%
- Aerial mismatch > X cm

**Why**
- This is where AI beats humans
- Converts data → real tactical advantage

---

## 6. Tempo & Rhythm Control (Often Ignored)

### Add: Tempo Management
- After goal: Slow tempo (2–3 mins)
- After concession: Fast tempo
- After sustained press: Slow circulation to recover

**Why**
- Prevents emotional chaos
- Feels “coached”, not scripted

---

## 7. Defensive Weakness Exploitation Routes (More Specific)

### Add execution paths (instead of generic weakness text)
- Vertical pass → half-space run → cutback
- Third-man run from CM
- Early switch of play

**Why**
- Moves from analysis → execution

---

## 8. Risk Management Layer (Coach-Level)

### Add: Risk Profile
- Current Risk Level: HIGH
- Allowed turnovers in middle third: LOW
- Allowed long shots: MEDIUM

**Automatic Adjustment**
- Risk decreases after 70’

**Why**
- Prevents tactical suicide
- Coaches think in risk windows

---

## 9. AI Confidence Explanation (Trust Builder)

### Add: Confidence Drivers
- Data sample size: HIGH
- Opponent pattern consistency: MEDIUM
- Match context similarity: HIGH

**Why**
- Coaches trust AI that explains itself
- Transparency = adoption
