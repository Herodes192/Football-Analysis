# Tactical Suggestions TODO

**Last Updated:** 23 de dezembro de 2025

## 1. Game-State Aware Adjustments (CRITICAL)

### Add: Game State Adaptation

**If Leading**
- Press: MEDIUM BLOCK
- Tempo: CONTROLLED
- Fullbacks: One stays, one overlaps

**If Drawing**
- Press: HIGH
- Tempo: FAST

**If Trailing**
- Press: VERY HIGH
- Defensive Line: +5-10m
- Risk tolerance: HIGH

**Why this matters**
- Prevents over-pressing when ahead
- System feels "match-aware"
- Huge realism boost

---

## 2. Rest Defense & Counter Prevention (BIG GAP)

### Add: Rest Defense Structure
- Shape in possession: 2-3 base
- CBs: Hold central lanes
- DM: Screen zone 14
- Fullbacks: Staggered (one high, one deeper)

**Trigger**
- Opponent counter threat detected

**Why**
- High press + overlapping FBs = counter vulnerability
- Elite teams win by controlling transitions

---

## 3. Pressing Triggers (Elite Detail)

### Add: Pressing Triggers
- Back pass to CB or GK
- Poor first touch
- Wide build-up near touchline
- Opponent facing own goal

### Add: Pressing Trap
- Force play wide, isolate fullback, 3v1 press

**Why**
- Makes the system actionable, not generic
- Massive tactical realism

---

## 4. Build-Up Pattern Suggestions (Missing Phase)

### Add: Build-Up Play
- Phase 1: GK to CB split
- Phase 2: DM drops between CBs
- Phase 3: Inverted winger occupies half-space

**Alternative**
- Direct build-up if press intensity > threshold

**Why**
- System should guide positional play, not only outcomes

---

## 5. Player Profile Exploitation (VERY POWERFUL)

### Add: Targeted Player Matchups
- Isolate slow CB vs fast winger
- Attack weaker fullback side
- Force play onto opponent's weak foot

**Trigger**
- Speed mismatch > X%
- Aerial mismatch > X cm

**Why**
- This is where data analysis beats humans
- Converts data to real tactical advantage

---

## 6. Tempo & Rhythm Control (Often Ignored)

### Add: Tempo Management
- After scoring: Slow circulation to absorb pressure
- After sustained press: Slow circulation to recover
- When trailing: Fast vertical play

**Why**
- Elite teams control game rhythm
- Prevents physical burnout

---

## 7. Zone-Based Overloads (Missing Detail)

### Add: Overload Instructions
- Half-space overloads (Mboula + FB + CM)
- Wide overloads (winger + FB + CM)
- Central overloads (False 9 + 2 CMs)

**Trigger**
- Opponent weak in specific zone

**Why**
- Numerical superiority = goal creation
- Coaches want zone-specific tactics

---

## 8. Set-Piece Exploitation (Underutilized)

### Add: Set-Piece Strategy
- Corner kick routines (near post flick, far post)
- Free kick zones (direct vs cross)
- Throw-in tactics (long throw exploitation)

**Trigger**
- Opponent weak at set-pieces

**Why**
- 30-40% of goals from set-pieces
- Huge tactical advantage

---

## 9. Confidence Explanation (Trust Builder)

### Add: Confidence Breakdown
- "85% confident because:"
  - 5 matches analyzed
  - Clear pattern detected (4/5 matches)
  - Statistical significance

**Why**
- Coaches trust systems that explain themselves
- Builds credibility

---

## 10. In-Game Trigger Conditions (Actionable)

### Add: Trigger Conditions
- IF opponent changes formation → suggest counter-adjustment
- IF Gil Vicente concedes → suggest tactical response
- IF opponent fullback sent off → exploit numerical advantage

**Why**
- Makes system feel like a live assistant
- Highly actionable

---

## Priority Order

1. **CRITICAL**: Game-state adjustments (Item 1)
2. **HIGH**: Rest defense (Item 2)
3. **HIGH**: Pressing triggers (Item 3)
4. **MEDIUM**: Player exploitation (Item 5)
5. **MEDIUM**: Build-up patterns (Item 4)
6. **LOW**: All others (Items 6-10)

---

## Implementation Notes

- These features require pattern rule updates
- Some require additional data collection
- All are feasible with current architecture
- Focus on high-impact, low-effort items first

---

**Next Steps:** Prioritize Items 1-3 for immediate implementation
